	<p class="intro">I will be a PhD student in the Neural Science program at New York University starting in Fall 2019. My current interests are in the molecular basis of behavior and cognition.</p>
	<p>I am currently a Research Specialist in the lab of <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/0004876/russell-margolis">Dr. Russell Margolis</a> and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where I study Huntington's Disease.</p>
	<p>I conducted my undergraduate work at Wellesley College, where I studied biochemistry and worked in the lab of <a href="http://academics.wellesley.edu/Neuroscience/gobes/home.html">Dr. Sharon Gobes</a>. There, I completed an honors thesis on changes in synapse morphology associated with song learning in zebra finches.</p>
