	<p class="intro">I am a Neural Science PhD student in the lab of <a href="http://tsienlab.med.nyu.edu/">Dr. Richard Tsien</a> at New York University, with an interest in the molecular basis of learning &amp; memory.</p>
	<p>I previously worked as a Research Specialist in the lab of <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/0004876/russell-margolis">Dr. Russell Margolis</a> and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where I published work on a drug screening of small molecule therapeutics for Huntington's Disease.</p>
	<p>I received my B.A. from Wellesley College, where I majored in biochemistry and worked in the lab of <a href="http://academics.wellesley.edu/Neuroscience/gobes/home.html">Dr. Sharon Gobes</a>. There, I completed an honors thesis on changes in synapse morphology associated with song learning in zebra finches.</p>
	<p>My other interests include: cooking, cycling, education, fostering cats*, and developing support networks for women and minorities in the sciences!</p>
