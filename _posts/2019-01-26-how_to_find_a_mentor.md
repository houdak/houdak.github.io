<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he value of a good mentor is immeasurable. In addition to being someone you can look up to, a mentor can provide you with practical advice on how to get into your field of interest, and with an example of what working in that field might be like day-to-day. They can also help you discover other potential career paths based on your interests, and expand your network by connecting you with their colleagues. And when you encounter obstacles, a mentor can give encouragement and validation to help you through it.

For young students, a teacher or parent can often fulfill this role. However, as you begin to develop more career-specific interests and goals, a mentor within that field becomes more useful. There is also a good amount of research[^1] [^2] [^3] confirming the positive impact good mentors can have, especially for women and minorities interested in STEM.

So now that I've convinced you that having a mentor is a great idea, you might be asking yourself, how does one actually find a mentor? And once you find someone who is willing to act as a mentor, how do you maintain that relationship? Speaking from my own experiences, I'd like to describe some of the strategest I've used:

## Mentoring Programs ##
_One straight-forward way to find a mentor is to go through a formal mentoring programs. These are often organized by larger career-oriented organizations, such as the Global STEM Alliance or by local universities. People interested in volunteering as mentors sign up, as well as younger people looking for mentors. Having been on both sides of the coin, I would highly recommend signing up for a program like this! Mentors in these programs are eager to work with younger "mentees" and are likely to be great resources! Many of these programs also go beyond one-to-one relationships with mentors by offering opportunities to interact with other mentors and mentees in the program. Thus, you can form a larger network of peers who you can relate to and grow with, as well as mentees with all sorts of backgrounds and experiences to learn from. I've highlighted a few of these types of programs in my "Resources" page, but there may be some in your local area as well._

## Research Advisors ##
_For those interested in pursuing a career in scientific research, your advisors are a great source of guidance even outside of the lab. This includes professors whose labs you work within, as well as any Post-docs and graduate students in the lab who might advise you. These people are training you not only to conduct research in their lab, but also to prepare you for the next step of your career, and are usually very happy to give advice as you plan for your future. Set up conversations with them to discuss questions you have, and ask for their opinions. For example, as I was applying for research technician jobs in my senior year of undergrad, my advisor went through labs that I had offers from helped me evaluate them based on their publications, what she knew about them, etc. When I was looking for jobs, I sent a former advisor my resume and he forwarded it to his colleagues who were hiring. This sort of support will be useful throughout your entire career!_

_Even more importantly, keep up with these people even after you no longer work in their lab! I guarantee you, former advisors __LOVE__ to hear updates about their trainees. To do this, every once in a while I send an email about a major accomplishment I have (ex. enrolling in college, getting a job, publising an article). If I'm in town, I also make an effort to visit. And when I attend a conference, I look for posters or presentations from former advisors and stop by to say hello. This doesn't need to be a constant thing - once a year or even once every few years - but it keeps the connection going!_


## Alumni/Alumnae ##
_Perhaps you become interested in a non-academic career, in which your professors may not be the best help (although you can give it a shot - they still might have connections). In this case, it is very likely that __somebody__ who graduated from your college/university is working in that career. Even if you do not know them personally, you have something in common - you both attended the same university! Most alumni/alumnae are happy to share their knowledge and connections with younger students whose position they once were in!_

_To find alum in your field of interest, you have a few options. LinkedIn is a site explicitly for forming new career connections. You can search by alma mater as well as by current job to find exactly who your looking for. The Career Center at you university may also keep a database of alumni's current jobs for this exact purpose._

_Once you find someone who fits the bill, send them a polite email or message asking if they'd be willing to talk with you (phone/in person/email) and give you some information about their job and how to enter that field. Make sure to be as respectful of their time as possible (you're asking for a favor from them!) and don't take it personally if they don't reply. That person just might be too busy to mentor someone, so just try someone else!_


## Your Peers! ##
_Forming connections with your peers will certainly help you in the long run! This includes students in the same year as you, as well as those a year or two above you. You can go to each other for editing help, choosing professors, or other advice. Since you are closer to the same stage, they will probably be able to give you more detailed advice on their recent experiences, as opposed to a professor who may have forgotten what it was like to apply for graduate schools when they did it decades ago. Having taken a couple years off between undergrad and grad school, friends from my year who went straight to graduate school helped me a lot as I was applying for PhD programs!_

#### Last Thoughts ####
One last note that I'd like to add is that ___you can never have too many mentors___. The goal is to create a support network for yourself that will get you through college, grad school, and beyond. Depending on the support you need, you'll be able to draw from different people within this network, and they'll be able to connect you with people in _their_ network, too! As you gain experience, you can bring your own mentees into your network and expand this network of support even further. :)

While finding a mentor might sound like an abstract process at first, I hope this explicit guide demystifies it a bit!
