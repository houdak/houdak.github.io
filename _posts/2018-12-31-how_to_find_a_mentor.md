<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he value of a good mentor is immeasurable. In addition to being someone you can look up to, a mentor can give you practical advice on how to get into your field of interest. They can also give you an idea of what a certain career is actually like day-to-day, and help you discover potential career paths based on your interests. When things get tough, a mentor can give you the encouragement and validation to help you get through it.

For elementary and middle school students, oftentimes a teacher or parent can provide most of these things. However, as you get a better idea of your interests in high school, a mentor within your specific career becomes more useful.

There is a good amount of research[^1-3] supporting on the impact a good mentor can have, especially for women and minorities interested in STEM. But how does one find a mentor?




[Discuss support network - get lots and lots of mentors!]
