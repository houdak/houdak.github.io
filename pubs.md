Huang Z, <b>Khaled HG</b>, Kircshmann M, Gobes SMH, Hahnloser RHR. Excitatory and inhibitory synapse reorganization immediately after critical sensory experience in a vocal learner. _eLife_. 2018 October 25. _[doi: 10.7554/eLife.37571](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37571)_

_In the lab of Dr. Gobes at Wellesley College, I studied the dynamic mechanisms involved in learning and memory acquisition in zebra finches. When I joined the lab, we had received a large dataset from our collaborator comprised of high resolution electron microscopy images of HVC (proper name), a nucleus of the songbird brain circuity, obtained at different stages of learning. While only comparisons of synapse numbers between experimental groups had been made at the time, I determined that changes in synapse morphology such as size and curvature also occur in response to sensory experience during learning. These results suggest a model for song learning in which structural imbalance of excitation and inhibition, represented by changes in both synapse numbers and morphologies, form a foundation for song memorization. This model could potentially be generalized to other modes of learning via sensory exposure, providing greater insight into how experience shapes brain structure to enable memory formation._
